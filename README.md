# Aboutlo's Dotfiles

After many years with a micro .bash_profile I finally move to get something more reliable.
This is my working progress dotfiles repo. It's still tiny but definitely better.

## Disclaimer
I'm a `Javascript` and `Ruby on Rails` full-stack dev. I work on a OSX box.
So what you find here is a toolbox for this environments.

## Install

    $ git clone git@github.com:aboutlo/dotfiles.git
    $ cd dotfiles
    $ chmod +x install.sh
    $ ./install.sh

## Post install

As web developer you have to deal with IE. Yes I know it's a sad news but you are pay to do that.
Run this infernal command to get any IE versions you need directly on your vm. ( ~45GB required for a full install )

    $ ievm curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xdissent/ievms/master/ievms.sh | env IEVMS_VERSIONS="8 9 11" bash

Take a cuppa. It will take a while...

## How to

Open a new terminal and you will get you new colored `PS1` prefix
